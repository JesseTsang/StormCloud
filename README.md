# StormCloud
Arduino based project to animate LEDs like a lightning in a storm cloud.

I originally designed this for a Halloween costume, but it can be used to animate any storm cloud item with an Arduino control board (like lamps or decorations).

While the board is running, it will randomly select one of any preset "paths" and fire a lightning animation repeteadly with a random amount of time as a delay between lightning.

Paths consist of 2 LEDs or LED strips. The first one will blink with a strobe effect, then it will light up. Then, the second LED in the path will light up with the first. Finally, both LEDs will turn off.
